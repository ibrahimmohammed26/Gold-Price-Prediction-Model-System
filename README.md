# Gold-Price-Prediction-Model-System
- This was one of the first machine learning projects I did, and this was done with Python and its libraries such as Scikit-learn, Numpy and others.
- Uses random forest regression, not linear regression here
- The table is a random dataset from Kaggle, and you can scroll down the table to access more values, and you can edit the table.
- To run, you need to use this command in Pycharm terminal: streamlit run C:\Users\ibrah\PycharmProjects\Gold-Price-Prediction-Model\[app.py](http://app.py/)
